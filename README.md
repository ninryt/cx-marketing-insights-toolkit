## CX & Marketing Insights Toolkit (SmartAgency Case Study)

This project was developed during a consulting collaboration with **SmartAgency**, a Freemium-based SaaS platform offering website creation tools. The company had a steady inflow of new users, with over 500 people registering for the free version each month — yet only about **1% converted to a paid plan**.

The core objectives were:
- To identify **factors affecting the low Free → Paid conversion rate (CR2)**
- To assess **channel performance across paid and organic campaigns**
- To build a **scalable, reusable analysis toolkit** that the team could use independently

---

## 🔸  Understanding the Challenge

The SmartAgency team lacked a consolidated view of:
- Where users were dropping off in the Freemium funnel
- Which marketing channels were most effective
- How their performance compared to competitors

There were no unified KPIs, no live dashboard, and no defined structure for tracking campaign ROI or user behavior across touchpoints.

---

## 🔸  My Approach

The project was divided into two key phases:

### 1. UX & Funnel Analysis
- I conducted a structured review of the user journey from signup through Freemium usage
- I identified friction points, navigation barriers, unclear upgrade value, and trust gaps (e.g., missing social proof)
- I mapped findings to potential impacts on CR2 and designed hypotheses for testing

### 2. Marketing KPI Framework & Dashboard
- I benchmarked SmartAgency’s performance against competitors (e.g., Webador, Onepage.io) using SEO/PPC data
- I modeled relevant KPIs: CPV, CTR, CAC, LTV, ROI/ROAS
- I built a **plug-and-play Excel dashboard** with automated calculations and filters
- The toolkit was designed to be used without technical skills, enabling continuous internal analysis

## 🔸  Key Deliverables

- A hypothesis framework explaining potential drivers of low CR2
- Competitor benchmarking based on search traffic, keyword strategy, and ad spend
- Fully modeled marketing KPIs with adaptable calculations
- Interactive Excel dashboard with filters and auto-updating logic
- Documentation and instructions for non-technical teams

---

## 🔸  Key Insights

- Onboarding friction and unclear upgrade value likely reduced user engagement
- Lack of visible reviews and trust signals impacted purchase decisions
- High CPV and low ROI suggested inefficient ad budget allocation
- There was no systematic way to compare performance across channels or optimize over time

---

## 🔸  Impact & Outcome

The project provided SmartAgency with:

- A structured way to track CR2 and funnel drop-offs
- A benchmarked view of their positioning vs competitors
- The ability to analyze campaign performance without needing additional tooling
- A foundation for future experimentation and optimization

---

## 🔸  Reusability

The Excel toolkit was built to be:
- 📊 **Modular** – works with new data inputs instantly
- 🔁 **Reusable** – applicable to future campaigns and other teams
- 💡 **Accessible** – no BI tools or coding skills required

---

## 🔸  Next Steps (Optional Extensions)

The toolkit structure can be easily migrated into:
- **Power BI** for dynamic dashboards with real-time data feeds
- **Looker Studio** with GA4, CRM, and Ads integrations
- **Streamlit app** for lightweight team access
- **SQL**-based pipelines for deeper cohort and retention tracking

---

## 🔸  Summary

This case demonstrates a combined approach of **UX-driven funnel analysis**, **marketing KPI design**, and **toolkit development** — all built with scalability and practical team use in mind.

It highlights the importance of:
- Aligning user insights with marketing performance
- Creating accessible tools that empower teams
- Bridging research and data to improve decision-making
