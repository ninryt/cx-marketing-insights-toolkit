This project began as a consulting engagement with SmartAgency â€” a Freemium-based SaaS product struggling to convert free users into paying customers.

While over 500 users were registering for the free version, only ~1% upgraded to a paid plan. My goal was to uncover the reasons behind this drop-off and provide a data-driven framework for improvement â€” not just through analysis, but by delivering a reusable, automated toolkit.
## ðŸ”¸ Features Challenge
The client wanted to understand why their Freemium conversion (CR2) was so low and how their marketing efforts were performing across multiple channels. They lacked structured KPIs, dashboards, and actionable insights.

## ðŸ”¸ FeaturesMy Approach
I split the project into two phases:
1. A strategic analysis of the user journey to identify UX friction points.
2. A technical performance evaluation across paid and organic marketing channels, supported by a plug-and-play Excel dashboard.

## ðŸ”¸ FeaturesDeliverables
- A set of hypotheses explaining low CR2, with validation strategies
- Competitive benchmarking (e.g., Webador, Webnode) using SEO/PPC data
- Fully modeled KPIs: CPV, CTR, CAC, LTV, ROI/ROAS
- Interactive Excel dashboard (filters, pivots, auto-calculation)
- Toolkit documentation allowing teams to reuse and plug in their own data

## ðŸ”¸ Features Key Insights
- Onboarding UX issues were causing drop-offs before value was communicated.
- Trust factors (few visible reviews, unclear benefits) blocked conversions.
- Paid campaigns showed high CPV and weak ROI compared to competitors.
- There was no systematic way to track campaign performance or conversion cost-effectiveness.
