It highlights the importance of:
- Aligning user insights with marketing performance ![BI Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Marketing%20Performance-000080?style=flat-square)
- Creating accessible tools that empower teams
- Bridging  ![Research Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Research%20-FF0000?style=flat-square) and ![Data](https://img.shields.io/badge/DataAnalysis-007ACC?style=flat-square)  to improve decision-making

## 🔸 Project Intro

This project was developed during a consulting collaboration with **SmartAgency**, a Freemium-based SaaS platform offering website creation tools. The company had a steady inflow of new users, with over 500 people registering for the free version each month — yet only about **1% converted to a paid plan**.

The core objectives were:
- To identify **factors affecting the low Free → Paid conversion rate (CR2)**
- To assess **channel performance across paid and organic campaigns**
- To build a **scalable, reusable analysis toolkit** that the team could use independently

## 🔸  Understanding the Challenge

The SmartAgency team lacked a consolidated view of:
- Where users were dropping off in the Freemium funnel
- Which marketing channels were most effective
- How their performance compared to competitors

There were no unified KPIs, no live dashboard, and no defined structure for tracking campaign ROI or user behavior across touchpoints.

## 🔸  My Approach

Before diving into the analysis, I reached out to the client to clarify several foundational questions. I wanted to understand:
- Who their users are (demographics, motivations, technical background)
- What business goals and market scope shape their product strategy
- What past research had already been done (e.g., surveys, interviews)
- Whether users on the free plan faced limitations (e.g., domain connection)

This initial conversation helped identify key information gaps and ensured that the audit would be relevant and focused. It also shaped the research hypotheses and prevented duplication of efforts.

Based on this foundation, the project was divided into two key phases:

### 1. UX & Funnel Analysis
- I conducted a structured review of the user journey from signup through Freemium usage
- I identified friction points, navigation barriers, unclear upgrade value, and trust gaps (e.g., missing social proof)
- I mapped findings to potential impacts on CR2 and designed research questions, hypotheses, variables and measurement metrics for testing

### 2. Marketing KPI Framework & Dashboard
- I benchmarked SmartAgency’s performance against competitors (e.g., Webador, Onepage.io) using SEO/PPC data
- I modeled relevant KPIs: CPV, CTR, CAC, LTV, ROI/ROAS
- I built a **plug-and-play Excel dashboard** with automated calculations and filters
- The toolkit was designed to be used without technical skills, enabling continuous internal analysis
